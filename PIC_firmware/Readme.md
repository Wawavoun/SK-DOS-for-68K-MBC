Here is the modified PIC firmware.

Hex file can be directly used for flashing the PIC.

"main.c" is the modified file into source tree.
Replace original "main.c" by this one if you want compile yourself the firmware.

I have used up to date (02/04/2025) MPLAB + XC8.
To do so the original project need some other modifications.
Its mainly a rebuild of all makefiles using command line "prjMakefileGenerator.bat" tool.
